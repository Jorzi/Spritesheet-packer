Implermentation of a maxRects sprite sheet packer
=================================================


The program is a command line application whose purpose is to convert a series of images (png only for now) into one single image, lining them all up without overlap, while minimizing the needed bounding rectangle.
The problem can be reduced to packing a series of rectangles as compactly as possible. This is essentially a 2-dimensional variant of the bin packing problem, and it is generally referred to as 2d bin packing.
The algorithm generally seen as one of the most space-efficient and consistent is known as the maximium rectangles (aka maxRects) algorithm.


The program implements several bin packing algorithms in a modular way as "QuadPacker" objects by using a common interface to access them.
Images are read from a specified folder and stored in memory. The bounding rectangles of each image are extracted from the image objects and used as input for the packing function.
In order to control the dimensions of the generated sprite sheet, a maximum width is specified.
Most 2d bin packing implementations start with a fixed size sprite sheet (often referred to as the bin), resizing it every time the bin is unable to contain all rectangles, or just assuming that the bin is large enough.
The implementation presented here, on the other hand, uses a bin of (practically) infinite depth, packing downwards from the upper-left corner, 
then cutting the bin depth to a minimum once all the rectangles are contained within the bin.
This gives the user the possibility to adjust the ratio of width and height, while eliminating the need for any resizing of the bin.

Scanline algorithm
------------------

The scanline packing algorithm is the simplest algorithm, implemented as a reference. It uses a brute force approach, sorting the quads from largest to smallest, then places them at the first possible location, searching for fit by moving the quad in a scanline pattern, starting from the top left corner. The packing ratio is surprisingly good, but one of its potential inefficiencies is that, at least theoretically, its performance depends strongly on the resolution of the images.

Guillotine
----------

The guillotine algorithm/data structure gets its name from the way it handles and stores the free space. When a quad is inserted into a free rectangle, the quad is aligned with the upper left corner and the remaining free space is split into two new rectangles. The algorithm always inserts the quad into the best fitting free area, filling up smaller spaces where it can. The main problem of this algorithm is that the free space is divided into rectangular regions that cannot overlap, therefore putting artificial constraints on where a quad can be placed.

MaxRects
--------

The primary goal of this application was to implement the maxRects algorithm / data structure. MaxRects can essentially be thought of as an evolution of the guillotine algorithm. When a quad is inserted, the free rectangle is divided into two other maximally large rectangles. However, since the rectangles overlap, all free rectangles need to be checked for intersection with the newly inserted quad. Additionally, in order to prevent the number of rectangles from growing exponentially, the list of free rectangles needs to be pruned after every insertion. This is done by identifying rectangles that are completely enclosed by another rectangle and removing them from the list.
