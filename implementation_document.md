Implementation of a maxRects sprite sheet packer
================================================


The program is a command line application whose purpose is to convert a series of images (png only for now) into one single image, lining them all up without overlap, while minimizing the needed bounding rectangle.
The problem can be reduced to packing a series of rectangles as compactly as possible. This is essentially a 2-dimensional variant of the bin packing problem, and it is generally referred to as 2d rectangle bin packing.
The algorithm generally seen as one of the most space-efficient and consistent is known as the maximium rectangles (aka maxRects) algorithm.


The program implements several bin packing algorithms in a modular way as "QuadPacker" objects by using a common interface to access them.
Images are read from a specified folder and stored in memory. The bounding rectangles of each image are extracted from the image objects and used as input for the packing function.
In order to control the dimensions of the generated sprite sheet, a maximum width is specified.
Most 2d bin packing implementations start with a fixed size sprite sheet (often referred to as the bin), resizing it every time the bin is unable to contain all rectangles, or just assuming that the bin is large enough.
The implementation presented here, on the other hand, uses a bin of a preset width and (practically) infinite depth, packing downwards from the upper-left corner, 
then cutting the bin depth to a minimum once all the rectangles are contained within the bin.
This gives the user the possibility to adjust the ratio of width and height, while eliminating the need for any resizing of the bin. It does, however, limit the number of useful heurisitcs that can be used in the algorithms, since any heuristic that doesn't pack from top to bottom will see unlimited amounts of space and use it in an inefficient way.

Scanline algorithm
------------------

The scanline packing algorithm is the simplest algorithm, implemented as a reference. It uses a brute force approach, sorting the quads from largest to smallest, then places them at the first possible location, searching for fit by moving the quad in a scanline pattern, starting from the top left corner. The packing ratio is surprisingly good, but one of its potential inefficiencies is that its performance depends strongly on the resolution of the images.
For small sprite sheets (1204 x 1024 and lower) this is not a big problem, but for production-size sheets with several hundreds of individual sprites, the computation times very quickly become prohibitively long, even on today's top-of-the-line hardware. Theoretically, its time requirement is O(N^2*A) where N is the number of sprites and A is she total area (in pixels) of all the sprites combined. If we assume that each sprite has approximately the same area, we get that A is proportional to N and the performance becomes O(N^3*a), where a is the average area of one sprite.

Guillotine
----------

The guillotine algorithm/data structure gets its name from the way it handles and stores the free space. When a quad is inserted into a free rectangle, the quad is aligned with the upper left corner and the remaining free space is split into two new rectangles. The algorithm always inserts the quad into the best fitting free area, filling up smaller spaces where it can. The main problem of this algorithm is that the free space is divided into rectangular regions that cannot overlap, therefore putting artificial constraints on where a quad can be placed. The time requirement of my implementation of this algorithm is O(N^2), since the number of free rectangles increases by one for every inserted sprite and the algorithm checks all free rectangles for suitability. If the free rectangles were sorted according to their area, this could be optimised by checking only rectangles whose area is larger or equal to that of the inserted sprite. This would, however, not improve the worst case scenario.

MaxRects
--------

The primary goal of this application was to implement the maxRects algorithm / data structure. MaxRects can essentially be thought of as an evolution of the guillotine algorithm. When a quad is inserted, the free rectangle is divided into two other maximally large rectangles. However, since the rectangles overlap, all free rectangles need to be checked for intersection with the newly inserted quad. Additionally, in order to prevent the number of rectangles from growing exponentially, the list of free rectangles needs to be pruned after every insertion. This is done by identifying rectangles that are completely enclosed by another rectangle and removing them from the list.
The pruning procedure itself has a time requirement of O(N^2), since it checks every free quad with all the other free quads. This gives the algorithm a worst case time requirement of O(N^3). Theoretically, this could be improved by, for example, spatially sorting the quads using something like a quad tree, reducing the requirement to O(N^2*log(N)). In practice, however, the current implementation is already significantly faster than the scan line algorithm by being resolution independent, speeding it up by a factor a, whose order of magnitude is around 10 000 for modern games. Empirical tests also suggest that the packing ratio is about as good as that of the scanline algorithm.
